Redis-based components for Scrapy.

* Usage: https://github.com/rmax/scrapy-redis/wiki/Usage
* Documentation: https://github.com/rmax/scrapy-redis/wiki.
* Release: https://github.com/rmax/scrapy-redis/wiki/History
* Contribution: https://github.com/rmax/scrapy-redis/wiki/Getting-Started
* LICENSE: MIT license

Features
--------

* Distributed crawling/scraping

    You can start multiple spider instances that share a single redis queue.
    Best suitable for broad multi-domain crawls.

* Distributed post-processing

    Scraped items gets pushed into a redis queued meaning that you can start as
    many as needed post-processing processes sharing the items queue.

* Scrapy plug-and-play components

    Scheduler + Duplication Filter, Item Pipeline, Base Spiders.

* In this forked version: added ``json`` supported data in Redis

    data contains ``url``, ```meta``` and other optional parameters. ``meta`` is a nested json which contains sub-data.
    this function extract this data and send another FormRequest with ``url``, ``meta`` and addition ``formdata``.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: json

        { "url": "https://exaple.com", "meta": {"job-id":"123xsd", "start-date":"dd/mm/yy"}, "url_cookie_key":"fertxsas" }

    this data can be accessed in `scrapy spider` through response.
    like: `request.url`, `request.meta`, `request.cookies`
    
.. note:: This features cover the basic case of distributing the workload across multiple workers. If you need more features like URL expiration, advanced URL prioritization, etc., we suggest you to take a look at the Frontera_ project.

Alternative Choice
---------------------------

Frontera_  is a web crawling framework consisting of `crawl frontier`_, and distribution/scaling primitives, allowing to build a large scale online web crawler.
